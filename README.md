# Password Generator
This project helps users genreate passwords using any length between 8 and 128, also having the types of characters they please.

# Overview
This project in particular was mainly focusing on Javascript, and how to interact with the user. Using Vars, Loops, I was able to make the user answer a prompt and having them confirm what charaters they want on their password.
